libCUDF - CUDF (Common Upgrade Description Format) manipulation library
=======================================================================

libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
document describe an "upgrade problem", as faced by package managers
in popular package-based FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
distributions.

Usually, a CUDF document consists of a "package universe" and of a
"user request":

- The package universe describes all packages known to the package
  manager, a subset of which (the "package status") denotes the
  package being currently installed on the target machine.

- The user request denotes a change to the package status as requested
  by the user, e.g.: "install package foo", "remove package bar", ...

A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a "solution" describing
the resulting package status (if any) implementing the user request,
as found by a package manager.

libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.
