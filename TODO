* TODO add detection of multiple parse errors at once
* TODO provide Java bindings (via O'Jacare)
* TODO add support for computing checksums

** univ-checksum
** status-checksum
** req-checksum
* TODO better handling of preamble vs preamble option
  currently it is a tad annoying: Cudf_parser.load and friends return "preamble
  option", but that to obtain a real Cudf.cudf the user must resolve the option
  using default_preamble by herself
* TODO C bindings: support install/remove Makefile targets
* DONE revamp Debian package [100%]
** DONE port to recent dh-ocaml
** DONE general packaging update
** DONE upload to mancoosi.debian.net and Debian itself
* DONE update/verify C bindings [100%]
** DONE port old bindings to new types (fix all segfaults)
** DONE provide access to typed values
* DONE add line position to stanzas
* DONE add Lexing.new_line for backward compatibility w/ OCaml 3.10.x
** then update INSTALL downgrading OCaml dep
* DONE update/verify test suite
** TODO check the proper implementation of true/false wrt satisfiability
* DONE suppress trailing character after value parsing
  currently all trailing garbage is accepted because we create Lexbufs out of
  string and the grammar entries have no EOF
* DONE rewrite parser engine using a real parser
** ongoing (based on ocamllex/ocamlyacc)
